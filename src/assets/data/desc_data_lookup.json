    "description": "With its focus on electronic warfare, few ships can resist the direct onslaught of the Ishukone Watch Scorpion-class battleship's jamming capabilities.\r\n \r\n<font color=white><u>Details</u></font>\r\nThis variant of the Scorpion represents the pinnacle of the Ishukone paramilitary force's electronic warfare capabilities.\r\n \r\n<font color=white><u>Development</u></font>\r\nWhen Ishukone Watch was commissioned to produce a run of Scorpion-class battleships for its parent company, it was decided that a number of extra units would be offered to the capsuleer community to help fund the effort. Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet's production.\r\n\r\nThe first of these vessels was awarded to Gallente pilot Jack DuVal on June 4th YC115 as a gesture of good will, after it was stolen from an Ishukone Watch shipyard in orbit of Caldari Prime by the Guristas Pirates, before being abandoned in his hangar in Korama after a lengthy pursuit across the Caldari Border Zone.\r\n \r\n<font color=white><u>Technology</u></font>\r\nThough the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special Ladar and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.\r\n\r\n<font color=white><u>Notes</u></font>\r\nMany wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an \"incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority.\"",

Since then, further studies by Ishukone technicians have revealed several additional ways the microcontroller can be used, such as control mechanisms in robots for industrial usage. Experts claim that the microchip does not offer higher efficiency in the robots compared to already established methods due to its reliance of a biomechanical host system.",

Originally, asteroid miners had seen the tractor beams and in-space catalytic conversions used by today's Gas Scoops as a promising new method for extracting spaceborne ore. After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology, which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession to this day.\r\n\r\nWhen the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from. Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed, there was a need for much greater efficiency. It was not until the mining industry returned to long-abandoned projects that a solution was found. Since that time, Gas harvesting technology has slowly moved forward, giving birth to new industries and economies in the process.",

Originally, asteroid miners had seen the tractor beams and in-space catalytic conversions used by today's Gas Scoops as a promising new method for extracting spaceborne ores. After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology, which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession to this day.\r\n\r\nWhen the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from. Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed, there was a need for much greater efficiency. It was not until the mining industry returned to long-abandoned projects that a solution was found. Since that time, Gas harvesting technology has slowly moved forward, giving birth to new industries and economies in the process.\r\n\r\nResearch interest picked back up in Gas harvesting technology when new, stable wormholes began proliferating across the cluster. As soon as the wormholes were discovered, so too, were the giant gas cloud pockets within the unknown systems they linked to. In a single day, the demand for Tech II Gas Cloud Scoop exploded. Research projects were hastily established and grants hurriedly thrown out to the most promising firms pursuing a redesign. It was only a few days before a breakthrough was made, and all the harvesting technology that had come before was quickly relegated to second place.",

    "description": "An electronic interface designed to augment and enhance a Force Auxiliary Ship's defenses and logistical abilities. Through a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts, the triage module diverts energy from the ship's propulsion and warp systems to lend additional power to its defensive and logistical capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis results in a great increase in the Force Auxiliary's ability to provide aid to members of its fleet, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance. Defensive benefits include improved self-repair and shield boosting effectiveness, as well as increased resistance to most forms of electronic warfare. As a side effect of the ionic flux created by the triage module, beneficial remote repair and capacitor transfer effects are ineffective against the fitted ship while the module is active.\r\n\r\nThe flux only disrupts incoming effects, however, meaning the Force Auxiliary can still provide aid to its cohorts. Sensor strength and targeting capabilities are also significantly boosted. In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship, nor is the Force Auxiliary able to dock until out of triage mode. Finally, any drones currently in space will be unable to deal damage when the module is activated.\r\n\r\nNote: A triage module requires Strontium Clathrates to run and operate effectively. Only one triage module can be run at any given time, so fitting more than one has no practical use. The remote repair module bonuses are only applied to capital sized modules. The increased shield boosting and armor repairing gained from the Triage Module is subject to a stacking penalty when used with other similar modules that affect the same attribute on the ship.\r\n\r\nThis module can only be fit on Force Auxiliary Ships.",

A key element of the industrial capacity unlocked by activating an industrial core is the ability to use compressor modules, with the Orca having the flexibility to use a number of specialized large compressors.\r\n\r\nThe Orca uses much of the technology developed by ORE for the Rorqual and integrated with the latest advancements from Deep Core Mining research division has developed a vessel which offers a diverse role to all sizes of operations and needs.",

This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull.

Functions familiar to any capsuleer such as the overview, tactical overlay and hostile threat indicators are just a few examples of the device's capabilities. \r\n\r\nAlthough NVI technology has been around since the inception of the capsule, the addition of salvaged Sleeper drone components and the now widely available fullerene polymers has carried the functionality forward into the new Tech III paradigm.

Typically, the EMI Nexus acts as a conduit between a capsuleer and their ship, serving as an interface through which they can operate normally automated electromechanical systems, such as a Central System Controller. Other more simple tasks, such as the activation of a ship's modules, also frequently rely on these components.",

    "description": "As a capsuleer, few things are more important in space-flight than the ability to instantly gauge one's surroundings and make decisions accordingly. For this reason, capsules inside starships make frequent use of neurovisual reproductions; emulations that recreate external stimuli using the most low-latency processor available: the human brain. This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After the data is captured, it is then relayed directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously.\r\n\r\nThe synthetic translation of external stimuli into neurovisual imagery is incredibly risky, even relative to the standard hazards of pod piloting. Even though capsuleers have an innate resistance to neurobiological damage from these sorts of processes, the near- constant exposure to them has been linked to increased risk of aggressive neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, engineers have begun to integrate neurovisual output analyzers into a starship's electronics systems. These devices monitor the pilot's status and, if necessary, take measures to protect against anything from mild headaches to catastrophic neural failure.",

    "description": "These conduits supply power to minute, molecular-level devices. Extremely strong and yet surprising flexible, they have traditionally been used in rare situations where the normal methods of power supply were rendered impossible. The advent of Tech III starship technology and the influx of fullerene-based materials have seen the conduits take on new and more widespread roles. \r\n\r\nThe addition or removal of a single subsystem in a Tech III vessel can drastically change the ship's structure, and with it the internal wiring and available power supply routes.  Fulleroferrocene power conduits have become an essential component in the construction of these new vessels for this very reason. The conduits can be remapped through a ship with relative ease, allowing for the near-endless variations of subsystems to be completely interchangeable without posing any problems of how to power them.",

    "description": "Subspace calibrators perform the crucial role of tuning in on subspace frequencies. Being able to accurately pinpoint a destination on the other side of a wormhole is vital to interstellar travel, as it allows pilots to traverse wormholes safe in the knowledge that they won't accidentally arrive out the other side at the centre of a sun. \r\n\r\nThis particular calibrator was produced from a combination of fullerene polymers and salvaged Sleeper technology. The unique grouping enables some drastic reconfigurations to the basic design. The end result is a vastly increased efficiency in calculation time. Due to the modular design of Tech III vessels, tuning into subspace frequencies must be done individually for each subsystem. The development of this particular component has been an important time-saver in an area where mere seconds can mean life or death.",

If a fully activated mobile depot with high shields comes under attack, it will enter a 48 hour reinforcement period once damaged below 25% shield hitpoints. During this reinforcement period the depot does not provide refitting services and cannot receive new cargo, however existing cargo can be removed and the depot can still be scooped into a ship by its owner.\r\n\r\nMay not be deployed within 6km of another Mobile Depot, 50km of Stargates, Stations or Upwell Structures, 40km of a Starbase, or within 75km of a Moon Mining Beacon.\r\n\r\nAutomatically decays if abandoned for thirty days.",

The Villard Wheels allowed for an immensly rapid revolution of moving parts with almost no heat from friction, and the principles behind them were later put to use in the space industries of New Eden's various factions. Under normal circumstances they are nearly unbreakable.<br><br>This particular unit, however, is completely shattered, scorched and covered in soot.

Its official role to quickly appraise incidents of all kinds and relay information back to the Sisters of EVE also serves as an opportunity to take care of any sensitivities before they become apparent to external parties.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly adept at venturing into dangerous territories, not merely in recovering whatever may be of interest but also in being able to safely bring it back. Its engines have alternate power sources that come into play should any of its cargo - for which it has plenty of room - cause serious interference with internal systems. Its weaponry runs best on renewable sources, an ideal for a ship that doesn't know how long it'll be in deep space. Its carapace is extremely well armored for a ship this agile, and covered in sensors capable of letting its crew track a myriad of different organic signatures. The crew itself is safely protected from any number of transmittable ailments from rescues and other unexpected passengers, thanks to special quarantine bays that are conveniently located near jettisonable openings. \r\n\r\nAnd lastly, an ingenious but cryptic transfer in part of the warp core functionality to an outlying cylindrical structure means the Stratios Emergency Responder is able to run certain higher-level cloaking functions with very little technical cost, and minimal interference from warp. The Sisters of EVE have refused to comment on this technology, other than to recommend it not be tampered with.",

This means the vessel is able to carry vast amounts of ore in compressed form.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Rorqual is able to fit a capital tractor beam unit, capable of pulling in cargo containers from far greater distances and at far greater speeds than smaller beams can. It also possesses a sizeable drone bay, jump drive capability and the capacity to fit a clone vat bay. This combination of elements makes the Rorqual the ideal nexus to build deep space mining operations around.\r\n\r\nDue to its specialization towards industrial operations, its ship maintenance bay is able to accommodate only industrial ships, mining barges and their tech 2 variants",

It was soon realized that lack of experience in capital ship warfare had left fleet doctrines lagging behind the tactics of capsuleers fighting in the Outer Regions.\r\n\r\nFrom this realization was born the concept of the Force Auxiliary capital ship, a vessel dedicated to ensuring the survival of more combat- and command-oriented capital ships such as Carriers and Titans. The Apostle-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned in memory of Empress Jamyl I and is richly decorated in token of this dedication.",

The materials used to finish the Palatine Keepstar citadel, inside and out, are of highest quality and the design includes some key enhancements aimed at pushing the capabilities of this combination fortress and symbol of power to the utmost. The Palatine Keepstar is being offered under terms of a highly encrypted construction template that will limit the number that can be built and operated at any given time.\r\n\r\nLike the standard Keepstar, the Palatine Keepstar has been built with new spaceship tethering technology as standard, and it will accommodate all size classes of ship, including 'supercapital' vessels, in its internal docking bays. The defensive capabilities of the Palatine Keepstar are formidable and are highly enhanced in lower security star systems with the ability to mount area effect and 'doomsday' weapons. The Palatine Keepstar can be configured using Upwell's Standup brand service and structure modules so as to serve the specific needs of the structure operator. Further adjustment of the hardware of the Palatine Keepstar can be achieved by installed Standup XL-Set rigs to optimize the specific role of the citadel.\r\n\r\nOn June 14th YC125 CONCORD updated the capsuleer structure regulations to disallow the anchoring of any new XL structures in highsec space.

The Bosonic Field Generator provides a means to massively distort localized spacetime at short ranges, placing enormous stresses on any object in the affected area. In practical terms, the device is a weapon that can literally tear apart ships caught in its kill zone.\r\n\r\nNote: Activating this module triggers a massive capacitor disruption wave that impacts ships in the immediate vicinity of the Titan, friend or foe. After firing, you will be immobile for thirty seconds and unable to dock, tether, cloak, or activate your jump drive for five minutes.",

There was some truth to this, as the Amarr had simply not yet managed to hold the beam reliably on a single target point. The State managed to independently solve the problem of holding a focused beam of the pseudo-stable energy and the modifications necessary to create the \u2018Iron Pike\u2019 Kinetic Lance were soon made.\r\n\r\nNote: Activating this module triggers a massive capacitor disruption wave that impacts ships in the immediate vicinity of the Titan, friend or foe.

In contrast to this aggressive approach, the Sanmatar tasked the Republic Justice Department to use its considerable contacts with the Gallente Federation to overcome the hesitancy created by past tensions and border encounters between the two empires. As a result of this open policy, President Jacus Roden directed the Federation Navy to share its \u2018Lance\u2019 technology with the Republic Fleet and the \u2018Geiravor\u2019 Explosive Lance variant was quickly developed.\r\n\r\nNote: Activating this module triggers a massive capacitor disruption wave that impacts ships in the immediate vicinity of the Titan, friend or foe.

Creating such a compact ship while preserving much of the utility of the larger Orca and Rorqual designs proved a significant challenge, but the end result was a ship that had great potential for capsuleer mining operations in all areas of space.\r\n\r\nThe Porpoise can use a medium industrial core to substantially increase its industrial capabilities, while empowering its defenses during deployment in a static configuration. A key element of the industrial capacity unlocked by activating an industrial core is the ability to use compressor modules, with the Porpoise also having this capability, although limited to using medium gas and asteroid ore compressors.\r\n\r\nThe Porpoise is a smaller, more mobile and more affordable mining foreman platform that is perfect for supporting mining operations in dangerous space. It is capable of providing support to its allies through mining foreman bursts, remote shield boosters and survey scanners. The Porpoise also enjoys strong bonuses to mining drones, allowing it to pull in its own share of the ore in any mining operation.",

Does not apply to other Rorquals.\r\nAffected ships gain incredible shield resistances, along with -90% reduction in shield regeneration time, but lose the ability to deal damage, cloak, warp, dock, tether, or jump. Other effects include increased mass, decreased velocity and decreased scan resolution.",

    "description": "The Monitor was initially developed by the CONCORD Directive Intelligence Agency as an observation ship that could survive extremely hostile areas of space for observation and data collection missions against pirate, capsuleer, and emergent threats. To serve in this role the Monitor was developed with defensive technology inspired by the venerable \"Polaris\" line of frigates. After initial field testing demonstrated the incredible durability of this new vessel, CONCORD Aerospace realized that a civilian version would potentially prove valuable to capsuleer fleet commanders and the Inner Circle approved the distribution of blueprint copies directly to worthy capsuleers through the \"loyalty point\" program.\r\n\r\nFlag Cruisers like the Monitor are specialized in survivability and observation at the expense of virtually all other functions. Powerful shield generators and thick armor plating combine with the smallest signature radius of any cruiser to create one of the most durable ships ever seen in New Eden. The Monitor also enjoys impressive sensor capabilities and digital systems hardened against hostile electronic warfare. In exchange for these benefits the Monitor gives up virtually all offensive capabilities and utility. The Monitor is only able to use propulsion modules, low-power target painters, and probe launchers. This ship is the ultimate specialist, useful for fleet commanders who serve as a stable presence on a chaotic battlefield.",

The Nergal has been modified using a variety of designs but draws principally from the popular <i>Enyo</i>-class assault frigate, using the Triglavian energy systems and the light entropic disintegrator capacity create a fearsome attack ship.\r\n\r\nAs an assault frigate, the Nergal has improved microwarpdrive signature radius damping and can use an assault damage control for enhanced defense. This compact brawler also benefits from increased entropic disintegrator range and damage, while its Triglavian core systems give it advantages in the use of energy neutralizer and pulse weapons, as well as remote armor repairers.\r\n\r\n<i>\"Refitting the core Damavik hull type with the Enyo's assault modifications was relatively straightforward due to the larger size of the ship's frame. We were also able to install improved drone bays and control bandwidth. A note on drones: one of our technicians improperly accessed a locked out section of the Triglavian encryption database and inadvertently activated a dormant subversion routine. Damage to the testbed was extensive. Unfortunately, no disciplinary action is necessary and next of kin have been informed according to cover protocols.

The Zirnitra's basic design has been successfully adapted for use with capsule technology, based on lessons learned from retrofitting the numerous Triglavian ship designs recovered from Abyssal Deadspace.\r\n\r\nThe Zirnitra is able to wield the truly titanic Ultratidal Entropic Disintegrator alongside an array of support modules typically favored in Triglavian designs. These include energy neutralizers, pulse weapons and a long-range remote repair capability.\r\n\r\n<i>Zirnitra Subclade of Veles Clade reclaimed adaptation schema for 2,187 tactical troika classification vessel in response to profound now-time pressure of prayer from Detached Executive Troika for Sublimation of Poshlost Flow.

    "description": "This extra-large Entropic Disintegrator is only seen in use on Triglavian capital ships, these massive ships being capable of managing the considerable radiation and enormous gravitational tidal forces the weapon generates. At the energy levels of this ultraheavy weapon system, the tidal forces are so powerful that even the special systems built into battleships are insufficient and only capital ships can deal with the forces involved.\r\n\r\nEntropic Disintegrators draw on the tremendous power of the Triglavian singularity-based energy systems to convert exotic matter into a particle stream directed with locally generated entropic force. While powerful, the range of the weapon is limited by the attenuation of entropic forces, which dissipate critically beyond the optimal range. As a result this weapon has no falloff range.\r\n\r\nThe particle stream generates thermal and explosive reactions on impact, and the entropic forces resolve into a localized gravitational conduit that steadily increases the acceleration on the exotic particles. In effect, the weapon's damage potential increases to a maximum level as long as the particle stream is kept on the same target.\r\n\r\nRequires exotic plasma charge ammo types: Baryon, Meson, and Tetryon.",

    "description": "The project to adapt Arcing Vorton Projectors into ship-based weapons required the development of a high-capacity energy source for the new weapons. Ship capacitors are powerful but the immense bursts of energy required to fire Vorton Projectors called for the development of one-shot Condenser Packs capable of retaining ultra-high charges and rapidly discharging them at need. In a novel and elegant solution to the problem of cabling burnout in the projectors, the material of the Condenser Packs is designed to be rendered down into a pool of nanites the ablative nanocabling of the weapons can draw on.\r\n\r\nUpwell's ElectroPunch Ultra brand of Condenser Packs are advanced charges designed to deliver a pulse of power tuned to develop arcs dealing balanced high damage at very short ranges.",

To overcome the limitations of standard capsuleer cloning, particularly the need to pre-install compatible clone blanks at a cloning location, the system relies on capsuleers using a special augmentation: the Nanoheuristic Clone Mapper.\r\n\r\nThe Tactical Capsuleer Recloner uses rapid nanosculpting technology to tailor default clone blanks to individual capsuleers using data received from the Nanoheuristic Clone Mapper augmentation. Capsuleers with clone mappers installed are therefore able to reclone at an active Tactical Capsuleer Recloner in the local system.\r\n\r\nWhile the recloning bay is the heart of the TCR facility, it also contains industrial nanofabs capable of flash-fabricating capsules, together with launch tubes that will rapidly deliver the recloned capsuleer to their new ship. \r\n\r\nNote: The recloning action requires material from fuel blocks stored in Supercarrier. The type of fuel block needed is specific to each Supercarrier and can be found in their attributes.",

CONCORD's AG12 technology monitoring section believes ORE's staff were significantly assisted by the collaboration of Intaki Syndicate engineers working within the Upwell Consortium partnership. CONCORD is concerned that illegal booster manufacturing and smuggling may increase due to the development of such enhanced gas harvesting technology.",

The use of dogs in open battle is forbidden regardless of the uses an enemy may put such beasts to.' \r\n\r\n\"I guess Rouvenor liked dogs, or maybe he really didn't like them. I'll be honest, I'm a bit ambivalent about using anything other than humans in war myself. Putting part of an operation, however small, under the control of an animal or a robot, expands the envelope of risk more than I'd like. Humans going rogue are risk enough, if you ask me. At least with a missile the point is that it blows up too. Still, I'll grant you things like drones do have their uses.\"</i>\r\n\r\n\u2013 Muryia Mordu, quoting the War Commentaries of dos Rouvenor",

    "description": "This bioadaptive mutaplasmid tool appears to share elements of both Triglavian and rogue drone technologies. First encountered as a key Triglavian tool for mutating the performance of various pieces of technology, this mutaplasmid is designed to colonize and radically alter a light combat drone. It is possible this application was originally developed for use with rogue drones controlled by the Triglavians but hives controlled by the so-called \"Unshackled Overminds\" have also adopted it. As with their repurposing of the technology of New Eden's core empires, independent rogue drones clearly have no difficulties when it comes using this characteristically Triglavian technology.\r\n\r\nThe mutaplasmid colony integrated into this bioadaptive tool is very unusual, even by the standards of this bizarre Triglavian technology.
