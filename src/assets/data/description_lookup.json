In latter years, even though now in full market circulation, these golden, metallic monstrosities are still feared and respected as enduring symbols of Amarrian might.",
  "643": "The mighty Armageddon class is one of the enduring warhorses of the Amarr Empire. Once a juggernaut that steamrolled its way into battle, it has now taken on a more stately and calculated approach, sending out a web of drones in its place while it drains the enemy from a distance.",
  "644": "Much praised by its proponents and much maligned by its detractors, the Typhoon-class battleship has always been one of the most hotly debated spacefaring vessels around. Its distinguishing aspect - and the source of most of the controversy - is its sheer versatility, variously seen as either a lack of design focus or a deliberate freedom for pilot modification.",
  "645": "The Dominix is one of the old warhorses dating back to the Gallente-Caldari War. While no longer regarded as the king of the hill, it is by no means obsolete. Its formidable hulk and powerful drone arsenal means that anyone not in the largest and latest battleships will regret ever locking horns with it.",

  "650": "Originally set to sail under the guise of \"Iteron\", this new iteration of an old and stalwart hauler is fast and reliable. It is equally popular among civilians and militaries due to its low price and ability to be fitted in myriad different ways. Despite its speed and resilience, however, it may need to be guarded while in particularly unfriendly territories, which is why it has also been outfitted with a drone bay for extra protection.",
  "651": "Aside from being endowed with the usual carrying capabilities of haulers, the Hoarder possesses an extra cargo bay.

  "654": "Aside from being endowed with the usual hauling capabilities of haulers, the Kryos possesses two extra cargo bays. They are both equipped with precise temperature and pressure controls; the first is celebrated specifically for ferrying minerals, while the second is calibrated at the extremely low temperatures required for harvested cosmic ice. \r\n\r\nThe Kryos was originally designed as a variant of the Iteron, but eventually evolved to perform an entirely separate role.",
  "655": "Aside from being endowed with the usual carrying capabilities of haulers, the Epithal possesses an extra cargo bay.

Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet's production.\r\n\r\nThe first of these vessels was awarded to Gallente pilot Jack DuVal on June 4th YC115 as a gesture of good will, after it was stolen from an Ishukone Watch shipyard in orbit of Caldari Prime by the Guristas Pirates, before being abandoned in his hangar in Korama after a lengthy pursuit across the Caldari Border Zone.\r\n \r\nTechnology\r\nThough the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special Ladar and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nMany wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an \"incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority.\"",

Defensive benefits include improved self-repair and shield boosting effectiveness, as well as increased resistance to most forms of electronic warfare. As a side effect of the ionic flux created by the triage module, beneficial remote repair and capacitor transfer effects are ineffective against the fitted ship while the module is active.\r\n\r\nThe flux only disrupts incoming effects, however, meaning the Force Auxiliary can still provide aid to its cohorts.

After that, the fused nanomechanical engines are connected to one another, forming a composite whole. \r\n\r\nAlthough mechanical engineers have theorized about this construction method for many decades, the process was always held back by a lack of fullerene material. It is said that only hours after the discovery of fullerite clouds in wormhole space, the empires used significant amounts of their fullerene stockpiles to produce these engines. The reasoning behind this is simply the staggering breadth of potential applications these engines have. When it comes to engineering, there isn't much they can't do.",

This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After capturing the data, they then feed it directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously. Functions familiar to any capsuleer such as the overview, tactical overlay and hostile threat indicators are just a few examples of the device's capabilities. \r\n\r\nAlthough NVI technology has been around since the inception of the capsule, the addition of salvaged Sleeper drone components and the now widely available fullerene polymers has carried the functionality forward into the new Tech III paradigm.

Designers of Tech III vessels were initially hampered by the problem of how to design a modular ship that could swap out basic engineering upgrades on a per-need basis. This proved particularly true when it came to increasing a vessel's capacitor size without the use of batteries. In the end, the provision of fullerene-based polymers allowed for solutions that had only existed in theory up until that point.\r\n\r\nSubsystem Skill Bonus: \r\n5% bonus to capacitor capacity per level.",

This results in a drastic increase in the speed and efficiency of energy flow throughout a ship. The quicker that the surplus power can be redirected back to the core, the more that it can contribute to the overall recharge rate of the capacitor.\r\n\r\nSubsystem Skill Bonus: \r\n5% bonus to capacitor recharge time per level.",

Those first small advances made by reverse-engineering ancient Sleeper hulls were seen by many as simply the beginning of something greater. For these and other reasons, few were surprised by the introduction of a subsystem focused purely on pushing the \u201cheat\u201d envelope. \r\n\r\nVarious designs surfaced in the weeks and months following the opening of the new wormholes, each offering increasingly smaller improvements on the last. Research seemed to stagnate for a while and it was not until the idea of additional, localized coolant injectors became widespread that heat-focused subsystems truly began to perform in a class of their own. The current iterations offer pilots truly unprecedented abilities when it comes to overheating and pushing modules to their limits. Military experts and even capsuleers alike have been left wondering just how drastically this new design, along with so many other radical new entries to the subsystems field, will reshape interstellar warfare.   \r\n\r\nSubsystem Skill Bonus:\r\n5% Reduction in the amount of heat damage absorbed by modules per level.",

Ship identifier tags, hostile threat indicators and tactical overlay interfaces are all typical examples of N.I.M at work. The Sleeper variants of these matrices are not substantively different from contemporary devices, needing only a few supplemental components and some minor reprogramming before they can operate in much the same way. The only major deviation is in the energy efficiency. The Sleeper device is almost a thousand times less demanding on a ship's power core.",
  "30252": "These tiny nanomachines have been injected into the thermoelectric power core at the heart of the Sleeper drone. Inside each one is a small array of chemicals and components, all of which play a role in producing the often violent chemical reactions that provide power to the drones. Only the most advanced Sleeper drones are known to have had their power cores enhanced in this way. \r\n\r\nEven though they all share the same fundamental role, thousands of minor variations in the machines that have emerged after millennia of use, as they adapted to the minute changes in chemical composition and electrical flux. How exactly they came to do this remains a mystery, but it is clear that the current product is the result of countless iterations. \r\n\r\nAlthough salvaged easily enough, they have been built from the ground up to be integrated into other Sleeper technology. Trying to enhance any engineering systems outside of the Sleeper's own thermoelectric power cores with the current level of technology would represent an impossible reverse-engineering task.",

  "30259": "Most of these tiny circuits have fused together from the heat and force of the Sleeper drone's explosion. The detonation of the drone's power core must have been immense to have had such an effect on these resilient nanostructures.",
  "30268": "Barely salvageable from the wreck of a Sleeper drone, this device could have been something much more impressive when it was fully functional. In its current state it is almost unrecognizable, having been scratched, burned and even chemically melted. It looks like it was housed next to the drone's power core, which would explain the extreme heat damage it suffered when the drone exploded. \r\n\r\nStranger yet, it almost seems as if it was lined with some kind of triggered-release corrosive. The self-destruct mechanism \u2013 if that's even what it was \u2013 only caused so much damage, and the acid didn't burn cleanly through the center of the drive. \r\n\r\nEven as a shadow of its former self, it can be combined with other components to form a fully functional warp drive. Being capable of this, even in such a bad state, strongly suggests that the device was capable of other types of more advanced interstellar travel. Why a Sleeper drone was equipped with this level of technology remains a mystery.",
  "30269": "A rudimentary analysis of this device reveals an amazingly broad potential for the manipulation of nanomachines, allowing the user to reprogram them for numerous roles. The Sleeper defensive systems were so modular that, even though this particular node was designed to coordinate armor-repairing nanoassemblers, it could just as easily be reconfigured for shield defense.",
  "30270": "Still fully intact and operational, this device stands as a testament to the ancient Sleeper's impressive scientific achievements. Although thousands of years old, the technology inside it is not only comparable to modern electronic designs, but in some cases even exceeds it. \r\n\r\nCentral system controllers lie at the heart of a starship's electronics systems. They are responsible for coordinating the flow of information between various analyzers and control nodes, monitoring subsystems, and ensuring they receive the appropriate supply of electrical power. Tackling such complex tasks simultaneously (and with near-zero latency) demands immense processing power and faultless, error-free programming. Traditionally, a CSC would comprise a significant portion of the cost in a starship's electronics systems, but the fullerene-based Sleeper designs have provided breakthroughs in the efficiency of circuitry and presented new and improved methods for increasing computational accuracy. The end result is a drastically reduced cost for top-of-the-line performance.",
  "30271": "Although emergent systems are not fully-fledged Artificial Intelligences, they are often so advanced that they can border on sentience. The means by which they are created is also a common source for claims that they are in fact, full-blown AIs. Emergent system development is said to have been an early focal point in Jovian software design, where they hoped to create an atmosphere in which an advanced system could self-assemble its own consciousness and thus \u201cemerge\u201d as a sentient being. What became of these projects remains unknown, although the Jovians appear to have abandoned these pursuits many millennia ago in favor of something more tangible and containable.  \r\n\r\nDesigned from the ground up to perform complex, real-time combat calculations such as weapon tracking and heat optimization, this device shows the signatures of an emergent intelligence. Despite this, various hard limitations have been encoded into the device at the most fundamental level, greatly limiting its potential to evolve any further. Even in its current state though, it represents some of the most advanced combat electronics ever built.

Mechanical engineers first attempted to create the plating using plutonium metallofullerenes, but it was quickly discovered that even miniscule amounts of them had a sizeable impact on ship mass. When integrated into armor plating in larger amounts, they also risked turning the vessel into a giant warhead, something even less desirable. \r\n\r\nA solution was finally found. Tiny amounts of metallofullerenes would be integrated in conjunction with far larger quantities of graphene nanoribbons and then coated in powdered C-540 graphite. This process allowed the material to maintain structural durability whilst keeping mass down.

This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After the data is captured, it is then relayed directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously.\r\n\r\nThe synthetic translation of external stimuli into neurovisual imagery is incredibly risky, even relative to the standard hazards of pod piloting. Even though capsuleers have an innate resistance to neurobiological damage from these sorts of processes, the near- constant exposure to them has been linked to increased risk of aggressive neurodegenerative diseases.

The martyrdom of Empress Jamyl I was inflicted with base treachery but its lasting effect will be the inspiration of a thousand generations down the ages.\" - excerpt from the Funeral Oration on the Passing of Empress Jamyl I by High Chaplain Kalefa Sufrin an-Kador, YC117.09.20\r\n\r\nFollowing the assassination by a Drifter strikeforce of Empress Jamyl I while she was aboard an Avatar-class Titan in late August YC117, there was a period of soul-searching and close scrutiny of capital ship doctrines by the Imperial Navy's staff officers. It was soon realized that lack of experience in capital ship warfare had left fleet doctrines lagging behind the tactics of capsuleers fighting in the Outer Regions.\r\n\r\nFrom this realization was born the concept of the Force Auxiliary capital ship, a vessel dedicated to ensuring the survival of more combat- and command-oriented capital ships such as Carriers and Titans. The Apostle-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned in memory of Empress Jamyl I and is richly decorated in token of this dedication.",

I've been trying to tell the Navy this for years.\" - remarks by Ishukone CEO Mens Reppola on the occasion of the Amarr-Caldari Capital Warfare Summit, YC118.01.15\r\n\r\nA well established and close co-operation between Amarr and Caldari capital warfare tacticians and naval architects all but guaranteed that the Amarr would share their conclusions on the need to alter capital warfare doctrines and accommodate such changes with updated designs and new ship concepts.\r\n\r\nThe infusion of Amarr thinking on the subject of capital ship warfare served to break a long-standing impasse between doctrinal factions in the Caldari Navy's strategic command. The wisdom of learning from the example of the most experienced capital warfare pilots in New Eden was accepted and the Minokawa-class Force Auxiliary was the eventual result.",

In large part this was due to a flaring up of the old debate between the firepower- and maneuver-oriented generals of the Brutor dominated military circles and the logistics- and fighter-oriented Sebiestor fleet tactician and technologist circles.\r\n\r\nAfter much chest-beating, and due in no small part to the intervention of Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor, the arguments of the Sebiestor won out and the Lif-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned over the objections of the Brutor military elite.",

Naturally these directives will be subject to democratic oversight in the best traditions of our Federation.\" - Gallente President Jacus Roden, Address to the Peoples of the Federation, YC118.01.21\r\n\r\nMilitary experts within the Gallente Federation were not slow in recognizing the significance of the agreements made between the Empire and State at the Amarr-Caldari Capital Warfare Summit of January YC118. The military-industrial complex of the Federation was more than equal to the task of implementing the necessary changes to existing designs in line with the concepts inspired by capsuleer capital warfare practice.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Intelligence Office additionally recommended that the Gallente build a Force Auxiliary capital of their own to maintain parity with the Amarr-Caldari alliance. The resulting crash development program created the Ninazu-class Force Auxiliary.",

While powerful, the range of the weapon is limited by the attenuation of entropic forces, which dissipate critically beyond the optimal range. As a result this weapon has no falloff range.\r\n\r\nThe particle stream generates thermal and explosive reactions on impact, and the entropic forces resolve into a localized gravitational conduit that steadily increases the acceleration on the exotic particles.

Don't get fixated, no pun intended, on the details of his kind of warfare. I've seen scouts pin down battleships, but that's not the point. Use the right force mix, and have them use the right tools to pin down an enemy force of such and such strength. That's the lesson here. But yeah, don't try and scramble a Nyx with a Garmur.

I'll be honest, I'm a bit ambivalent about using anything other than humans in war myself. Putting part of an operation, however small, under the control of an animal or a robot, expands the envelope of risk more than I'd like. Humans going rogue are risk enough, if you ask me.

As something inevitably had to give in the quest for enhanced scouting and combat capabilities, the Federation Navy made no bones about specifying a requirement that removed special salvaging efficiency systems from the Imicus Navy Issue.\r\n\r\nCreoDron and Roden Shipyards put in a successful joint upgrade bid that promised significantly upgraded drone capabilities coupled with special processing systems to support a probe launcher alongside the new drone systems.

  "73789": "Imperial Navy ship design doctrine tends to return to the tried and tested approach of heavy armor and high-efficiency energy weapons regardless of advances in technology and experiments with tactics. The upgrade brief for the Coercer Navy Issue certainly exemplified this tendency, notably calling for heavily upgraded armor systems and significant improvements in the energy use and damage output of its weapons.

The result is the Phoenix Navy Issue: a vessel equipped with heavier shields, significantly upgraded capital missile systems, and enhanced with target-painting technology to improve the application of its powerful weapons against any target this heavily-fanged monster cares to destroy.\r\n",
  "73794": "The Republic Fleet's requirements for an upgraded Thrasher focused on the doctrinal strengths of the Minmatar: speed and unleashing a hailstorm of projectile fire upon any foe in range. To that end, the designers of the Thrasher Fleet Issue paid great attention to the engine systems and reducing the downsides of using high-performance microwarpdrive propulsion modules. The improvements to weapons systems significantly increased projectile rate of fire and the range of effective firing solutions. Increased firepower at range came at the cost of reduced tracking systems and dedicated defensive module support, but additional base shield and armor were crammed into the design by the canny Minmatar designers.",
  "73795": "With the Cormorant well-established as a long-range anti-frigate platform, the Caldari Navy issued upgrade requirements that specified further enhancements to its ability to hit at range together with considerable improvements to defensive shield systems. Overhauling and expanding the energy systems and core processing systems to support these changes called for many changes to the base Cormorant's design. A joint tender from the megacorporations of the Ocean Faction proposing a total rebuild of the internal workings of the ship won the day.

  "73796": "Despite its reputation for over-reliance on drones, the Federation Navy makes use of a number of powerful \"gunboat\" designs at every scale of combat and the Catalyst's well-earned reputation as a potent anti-frigate platform led to a Navy Issue upgrade program.

Drones and automation are leveraged on this mighty foundation, enabling it to function and project power rapidly and precisely. To this end, the heavy-industrial powerhouse of Roden Shipyards put forward designs for an advanced dreadnought using new lance technology. Alongside an armament of hybrid turrets, the Hubris-class Lancer Dreadnought is equipped to use the new \u201cDisruptive Lance\u201d weaponry, a capability rumored to have been developed with the assistance of Jacus Roden\u2019s peerless industrial espionage organization.",

Close collaboration with their allies in the Republic Security Services, together with their own extensive contacts among the underworld cartels of New Eden, gave the Thukker engineers an up-to-date understanding of the \u201cDisruptive Lance\u201d technology that the Valravn-class Lancer Dreadnought uses alongside its batteries of projectile weapons.",

While this gunboat lacks the flexibility of missile options, it is able to deploy a covering flight of drones should it need to distract and disrupt any enemies.\r\n\r\nThe speed and formidable firepower of the Khizriel is enhanced by top-of-the-line shield and armor systems protecting an unusually agile battlecruiser.

It is possible this application was originally developed for use with rogue drones controlled by the Triglavians but hives controlled by the so-called \"Unshackled Overminds\" have also adopted it. As with their repurposing of the technology of New Eden's core empires, independent rogue drones clearly have no difficulties when it comes using this characteristically Triglavian technology.\r\n\r\nThe mutaplasmid colony integrated into this bioadaptive tool is certainly unusual, by the standards of this bizarre Triglavian technology, but the rogue drone nanotechnology elements appear less successful when applied to modular equipment than actual drones. The main result of mixing the technologies in this case has been to render all possible mutation ranges wildly unstable.\r\n\r\nTriglavian bioadaptive technology makes extensive use of engineered colonies of extremophilic bacteria, that are used to grow, harvest and adapt various resources found in Abyssal Deadspace. Artificial colonizing plasmids integrated into specialist tools used for direct adaptation of technology can be found in Triglavian caches in various stages of development. These mutaplasmids can be used to alter the characteristics of a wide variety of equipment types, depending on the strain and the bioadaptive tool with which they are integrated.",
